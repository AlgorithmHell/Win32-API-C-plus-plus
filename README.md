#HOW TO OPEN A PROJECT IN VISUAL STUDIO #
(IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK IN EXPRESS VERSION OF VISUAL STUDIO)


<p>0. Create a Win32 Empty project.<\p>
<p>1. File "Application.cpp" is the main file. Add item in Source files with .cpp extension and copy "Application.cpp" .<\p>
<p>2. Click on Resource Files (right click of course) and choose option "Add resource", then select "Dialog".<\p>
  now you can see a some kind of editor, but you are to click on this file, choosing an option "view code",
  answering "yes" for all notofications. Then delete everything from here and insert code with extension .rc .<\p>
<p>3. After all you may notice that file "resource.h" has appeared automatically. Open it and delete automatically-generated code 
   and insert the one with the extension .h .<\p>
<p>4. If some pictures need to be used, copy them in Resourse, or in a folder with the project, making them being "visible".  <\p>
